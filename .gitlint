# This is an example of how to configure the "title-max-length" rule and
# set the line-length it enforces to 50
[title-max-length]
line-length=80

# Conversely, you can also enforce minimal length of a title with the
# "title-min-length" rule:
[title-min-length]
min-length=15

# [title-must-not-contain-word]
# Comma-separated list of words that should not occur in the title. Matching is case
# insensitive. It's fine if the keyword occurs as part of a larger word (so "WIPING"
# will not cause a violation, but "WIP: my title" will.
words=wip

# [body-max-line-length]
line-length=72
