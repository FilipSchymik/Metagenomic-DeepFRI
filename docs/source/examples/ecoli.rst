*E. Coli* pangenome analysis
============================

To test our tool, we decided to annotate *Escherichia Coli* pangenome. *Escherichia Coli* is a well-studied
bacterial species. It is a facultative anaerobic, Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium abundant in human gut 
microbiome. They colonize the gut within hours after birth and coexist with human throughout whole life\ :footcite:p:`Kaper_2004`.
It also may exhibit pathogenic properties if it acquires virulence factors.
