
Welcome to Metagenomic-DeepFRI's documentation!
===============================================
Do you have **thousands of protein sequences** with **unknown structures**, but still want to know their
molecular function, biological process, cellular component and enzyme commission **predicted by DeepFRI?**
Metagenomic-DeepFRI is a deep learning-based software for functional annotation of metagenomes.
It combines both protein sequence and structure information for function prediction. It is a joint project of the `Systems Biology Research Group, Center for Computational Biology, Flatiron Institute, New York, USA <https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-biology/>`_
and `Structural and Functional Genomics Lab, Ma≈Çopolska Center of Biotechnology UJ, Krakow, Poland <https://www.tomaszlab.org>`_.

Setup
-----

1. Download environment YAML.

.. code:: console
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioinf-mcb/Metagenomic-DeepFRI/main/environment.yml

2. Setup conda environment and activate it.

.. code:: console

    conda env create --name deepfri --file environment.yml
