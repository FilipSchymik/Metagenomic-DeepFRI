Welcome to Metagenomic-DeepFRI's documentation!
===============================================
Do you have **thousands of protein sequences** with **unknown structures**, but still want to know their
molecular function, biological process, cellular component and enzyme commission **predicted by DeepFRI?**
Metagenomic-DeepFRI is a deep learning-based software for functional annotation of metagenomes. 
It combines both protein sequence and structure information for function prediction. It is a joint project of the `Center for Computational Biology, Flatiron Institute, New York, USA <https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-biology/>`_ 
and Structural and Functional Genomics Lab, Ma≈Çopolska Center of Biotechnology, Krakow, Poland.


Hey, want to contribute to the project and become a co-author?
